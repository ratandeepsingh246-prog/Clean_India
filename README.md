**Project Overview**
This project analyzes Swachh Bharat Mission solid waste management data published by the Government of India.
The objective is to transform raw public data into actionable insights using Power BI for state-level monitoring and district-level performance evaluation.

The project focuses on understanding legacy waste remediation, waste generation, processing capacity, and infrastructure gaps.

**📊 Data Source**
Official government open data portal
Data related to:
.Legacy waste (MT)
.Dumpsites
.Waste generation (TPD)
.MRFs, landfills, and disposal systems
.District-wise sanitation metrics
Note: The raw dataset required cleaning and restructuring before analysis.

 **Data Preparation & Modeling**
Cleaned and transformed raw data using Power Query
Handled missing values and inconsistent formats
Created calculated measures using DAX
Built relationships for district and state-level analysis

**Dashboard Structure**
1️⃣ State Overview
Provides a high-level summary of sanitation performance:
.Total legacy waste quantity (MT)
.Remediated vs remaining waste
.Total dumpsites and remediation status
.Target vs achievement indicators
.District-wise remaining waste using map visualization
Purpose:
Enable quick assessment of overall progress under Swachh Bharat Mission.

2️⃣ District Performance
Detailed district-wise operational analysis:
.TPD waste generation by district
.Waste processing through MRFs, landfills, and disposal systems
.Comparison of infrastructure capacity
.Identification of TPD gaps
Purpose:
Highlight underperforming districts and infrastructure shortfalls.

 **Key Insights**
Waste generation and processing capacity are not aligned across all districts
Several districts show significant gaps between generation and disposal
Remediation progress varies, indicating priority intervention areas

 **Tools & Technologies**
.Power BI
.Power Query
.DAX
.Data visualization & dashboard design
.Government/open data analysis

** Learning Outcomes**
Working with real-world government datasets
Data cleaning and transformation at scale
Designing decision-focused dashboards
Translating raw data into meaningful insights
